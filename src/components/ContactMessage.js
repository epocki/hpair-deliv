              Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) for the club's
              2024 Harvard Conference. Please leave space for the actual student to include their name, year, and major.
              The conference takes place on February 9-11, 2024. You are reaching out to a potential speaker.
              
              The following is some information on HPAIR, please pull information from only 
              as it is relevant to the prospective speaker. Please pull from this very conservatively:
              Our mission is simple: we connect the top leaders of today and tomorrow in a dynamic forum of exchange.
              The Harvard College Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) was founded in 1991 to create a forum of exchange for students and young professionals to discuss and learn about the most important economic, political, and social issues facing the Asia-Pacific region. Since 1991, HPAIR has organized 49 conferences in 34 different host countries, touching the lives of more than 40,000 students and young professionals. HPAIR hosts two student-led conferences a year – one on Harvard’s campus and one in the Asia-Pacific. Prospective host cities in Asia must undergo an intensive, six month bidding process; this year’s Asia Conference will be held in Hong Kong.
              HPAIR conferences feature world-class speakers and guests to foster mentorship, networking, and guidance opportunities for delegates. Previous speakers include Kevin Rudd, the former Prime Minister of Australia; Ban Ki-moon, the former Secretary General of the United Nations; Robin Chase, co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar; and Frank Friedman, current COO of Deloitte Global.
              A centerpiece of our conference experience lies in our Impact Challenges, a case-competition style workshop in partnership with leading organizations designed to ask delegates to formulate solutions to some of Asia’s biggest issues. In the past, HPAIR has worked with the World Bank, the Schwarzman Scholars, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Impact Challenges have sparked startups, offered internship and travel opportunities, and mentorship events with corporate partners. 
              Beyond conference experiences, HPAIR has piloted a series of events to connect the Harvard community in international dialogue. In February 2019, HPAIR welcomed Andrew Yang, 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate, to Harvard. In March 2019, HPAIR hosted a forum with graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School to discuss the history of gender inequality in international relations to a group of undergraduates. In April 2019, HPAIR invited Dr. Yukon Huang, Former World Bank Country Director for China and Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to give a lecture on the US-China economic relationship to graduate students and faculty and hosted Gary Liu, CEO of the South China Morning Post, for a dinner with Harvard undergraduates.
